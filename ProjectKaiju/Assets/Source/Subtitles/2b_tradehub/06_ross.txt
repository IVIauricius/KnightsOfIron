"Hello there, people of K-Line! Good news! Arezzo and Verona want to carve you up and burn you out, but the South Star doesn’t want to own you, we just want to own your stuff! Our organization is expanding, and I've asked some of my crew to come and explain just what we'll be needing from you. Now we can do this the easy way, or you can make it hard on yourselves, the choice is all yours!"
