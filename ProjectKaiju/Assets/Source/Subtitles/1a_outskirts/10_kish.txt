"Well done! You've stood tall for Eastgate! I admit it wasn't much of an assault, but defense of the gate is sure to attract the right kind of notice! Keep this battle record up and we'll be able to organize quite an event by the end of your mission! Once you enter the pass you'll be on your way to the old Tescan front. You'll know it when you see it."
