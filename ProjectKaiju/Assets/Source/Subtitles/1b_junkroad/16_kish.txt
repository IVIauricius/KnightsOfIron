"The closer you are the better your chances! I know this old bastard--he fought on the line. They used to call him The Javelin; he could hit targets from anywhere. Looks like his aim isn't what it used to be, but if he strikes you at long range you'll take catastrophic damage. Fighting so close you'll suffer some aim penalties too, but nothing like the trouble he'll have. Move in and keep him on the defensive!"
