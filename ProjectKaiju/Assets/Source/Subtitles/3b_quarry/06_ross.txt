"Not bad, not bad! You know those were some of my best guys! You're gonna leave us bruised and bloodied, that's for sure. But I think you get it, right? This whole region is on the brink, everybody's worn out and on the ropes. Which is why it's all gonna belong to whoever can keep up that momentum for the last big push. The days of living in isolation are done, kid. It's about going wide now. With the quarry and K-Line I'll have access to resources, a way to build up. And without you around, I'll just roll right through that east gate of yours and see what old Cosmo has to say. If we can find your head after I'll be sure to save it for him!"
